# Implementation validation

Validated locally on 2026-09-19. These checks establish tested implementation behavior, not a measurement of human review-time savings.

- Full Go tests and `go vet` pass on Windows amd64 with Go 1.27.1.
- Full tests with `-race`, and `go vet`, pass in Linux with Go 1.26 and networking disabled.
- Cross-compilation succeeds for Windows, Linux and macOS on amd64/arm64, with CGO disabled and version metadata injected. Cross-compilation does not substitute for native execution on those platforms.
- Real Docker tests use the official `golang:1.26-bookworm` image (observed digest `sha256:a688600ca24f8a4d3ca77f95b0dd40704a9fc787c826660eb7ba0b641b8b175d`).
- Container tests check absent host secrets, excluded credential files, blocked network, non-root identity, read-only source/root, ephemeral writes and unchanged host input.
- Real generated Go experiments verify both a baseline-pass/candidate-fail regression and a passing generated test despite an unrelated failing existing candidate test.
- A complete CLI test uses real commits, a scripted local provider and real containers. It asserts the reproduced-issue exit code, named-test evidence, retained source artifacts, merged audit history and unchanged checkout.
- Provider tests cover structured tool calling, input/iteration/time limits, unsupported tools, malformed responses and redirect refusal. No live paid/cloud model was required for these tests.
- The public JSON schema is checked as Draft 2020-12. Reports, output escaping, credential masking, evidence references and focused-line calculations have targeted tests.

Reproduce ordinary checks:

```sh
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
```

For actual container tests, preload a trusted Go image and set `SWIFTPROOF_TEST_DOCKER_IMAGE=golang:1.26-bookworm`, then run:

```sh
go test ./internal/harness ./internal/cli -run Docker -count=1 -v
```

Tests without that environment variable intentionally skip real Docker integration. The included CI workflow enables it on Linux. GitHub workflows themselves have been prepared, not run remotely or published as a release by this implementation task.
