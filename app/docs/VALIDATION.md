# Implementation validation

Validated locally on 2026-09-19. These checks establish tested implementation behavior, not a measurement of human review-time savings.

- Full Go tests and `go vet` pass on Windows amd64 with Go 1.27.1.
- Full tests with `-race`, and `go vet`, pass in Linux with Go 1.26 and networking disabled.
- Cross-compilation succeeds for Windows, Linux and macOS on amd64/arm64, with CGO disabled and version metadata injected. Cross-compilation does not substitute for native execution on those platforms.
- Real Docker tests use the official `golang:1.26-bookworm` image (observed digest `sha256:a688600ca24f8a4d3ca77f95b0dd40704a9fc787c826660eb7ba0b641b8b175d`).
- Container tests check absent host secrets, excluded credential files, blocked network, non-root identity, read-only source/root, ephemeral writes and unchanged host input.
- Real generated Go experiments verify both a baseline-pass/candidate-fail regression and a passing generated test despite an unrelated failing existing candidate test.
- A complete CLI test uses real commits, a scripted local provider and real containers. It asserts the reproduced-issue exit code, named-test evidence, retained source artifacts, merged audit history and unchanged checkout.
- Provider tests cover structured tool calling, input/iteration/time limits, unsupported tools, malformed responses and redirect refusal. No live paid/cloud model was required for these tests.
- The public JSON schema is checked as Draft 2020-12. Reports, output escaping, credential masking, evidence references and focused-line calculations have targeted tests.

Reproduce ordinary checks:

```sh
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
```

For actual container tests, preload a trusted Go image and set `SWIFTPROOF_TEST_DOCKER_IMAGE=golang:1.26-bookworm`, then run:

```sh
go test ./internal/harness ./internal/cli -run Docker -count=1 -v
```

Tests without that environment variable intentionally skip real Docker integration. The included CI workflow enables it on Linux.

The published v0.1.0 binaries are used by the new PR and deployment adapters.
The reusable PR workflow and pilot pass `actionlint`. The companion PulsarCD
implementation passes 528 targeted tests (API, security, build scripts and
SwiftProof), including an actual SwiftProof CLI invocation through its temporary
provider bridge with a simulated local provider. Tests cover changed image
digests, missing/corrupt evidence, human approval, absent LLM gates and separate
QA/production baselines. These integration changes have been validated locally;
their GitHub workflows and deployment gate have not been activated on the live
cluster by this task.

## v0.4 validation

Each block below records runs actually performed for one part of v0.4: the date, the environment, the commands and their exit codes.

### F0 foundation

**2026-09-25, documentation skeletons (F0e).** Windows 11 Pro amd64 host, Docker Engine 28.4.0, `golang:1.26-bookworm` (go1.26.8, digest `sha256:a688600ca24f8a4d3ca77f95b0dd40704a9fc787c826660eb7ba0b641b8b175d`). This change edits documentation only.

- `go vet ./...` and `go test -count=1 ./...` in that image: both exit 0.
- A Windows amd64 binary built from the branch (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) ran `lint` on a scratch Git fixture: exit 0, both report files written, checkout unchanged. An intent of `<<<<` is stored in the JSON as `<<<<`, six bytes per character, which the report-size note in [CI integration](CI.md#runtime-bounds-deadline-and-report-size) relies on.
- `swiftproof report --input` with a 67,108,865-byte report (64 MiB + 1 byte): exit 3, "exceeds 67108864 bytes". The same report at 67,107,840 bytes re-rendered with exit 0.
